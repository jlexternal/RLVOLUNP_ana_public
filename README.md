Analysis and model files for the RLVOLUNP study 

This repository provides all of the analysis used in the study codenamed RLVOLUNP. 

The folders provided are organized by type of analysis via alphabetical ordering. 
It is recommended to execute the code in the alphabetical order provided, and then by numerical order
within any given group. Please be sure to read the readme of each Group as they provide all the details
necessary for proper execution of the scripts or functions. 

Some groups, such as B and D, require you to write scripts that utilize the model fitting or simulation code 
we provided if one wishes to use the code on a new dataset. However, all data required to run all scripts are 
provided in the directories in the form of .mat or .csv files.
